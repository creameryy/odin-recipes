    <p>This lamb souvlaki recipe features marinated pieces of lamb, threaded on skewers, and char-grilled to perfection. I like to serve these with rosemary garlic roasted potatoes, a Greek salad, and pita bread.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of all fat and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add cubed lamb and stir until lamb is coated with marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.</li><br>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li><br>
        <li>Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade. Grill skewers until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.</li>
    </ol>
